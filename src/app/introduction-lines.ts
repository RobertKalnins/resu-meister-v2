"How does it work?",
"4 Steps - write, paste, describe, download",
"1. Write down your details. No need to filter anything out just include everything great about you",
"2. Paste in a job ad.", 
"We'll select the most relevant parts of your profile to build your resume",
"We'll also skim it and tell you what they're looking for",
"3. Then you describe yourself",
"4. Then we generate a resume using your own words, just the best bits for the job",
"Then whenever you see an ad, you paste it in, we'll work our magic",
